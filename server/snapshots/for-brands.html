  <h1>For Brands - Tony's Delight USA</h1>
  
  <p>Tony's Delight USA works with select international food and consumer packaged goods brands exploring entry into the United States market. Built from real-world importing, distribution, and e-commerce experience, we help brands navigate the early stages of U.S. expansion with clarity and structure.</p>
  
  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
  <p>This program is designed for established international brands that are based outside the United States, preparing for or exploring U.S. market entry, interested in wholesale distribution, retail placement, or e-commerce, and focused on long-term brand building rather than short-term experimentation.</p>
  
  <h2>How We May Support Brands</h2>
  <p>Depending on readiness and alignment, Tony's Delight USA may support brands with market entry strategy, distribution and logistics guidance, branding and positioning feedback, and Amazon and e-commerce enablement including FBA setup guidance and listing structure planning.</p>
  
  <h2>How We Work</h2>
  <p>We approach brand partnerships thoughtfully and selectively. Our focus is on building sustainable, compliant, and scalable pathways into the U.S. market rather than rapid or transactional launches.</p>
  
  <h2>Getting in Touch</h2>
  <p>International brands interested in exploring U.S. market entry can reach out for an initial discussion. Email <a href="mailto:info@tonysdelight.com">info@tonysdelight.com</a> or visit our <a href="https://tonysdelight.com/contact">Contact page</a>.</p>
