You are editing the Tony’s Delight USA website on Replit (tonysdelight.com). I need specific updates. Do not redesign, refactor, or remove anything that already exists unless I explicitly ask. Keep all existing styling, layout, spacing, typography, and components the same.

Absolute rules
1) Do not remove any existing links, icons, sections, components, or functionality.
2) Do not remove social links or social icons.
3) Make minimal code changes and only in the files required.
4) After changes, tell me exactly which files you edited and what you changed.

Goal
1) Ensure the footer contains correct Our Regions links (USA, UK, EU).
2) Ensure the footer contains working Instagram links for USA, UK, and EU, using the handles provided.

Requirements
A) Footer Our Regions
1) In the existing footer column titled “Our Regions” (or the equivalent existing column), ensure these three region entries exist as clickable links:
   1) USA: Tony’s Delight USA https://tonysdelight.com
   2) UK: Tony’s Delight UK https://tonysdelight.co.uk
   3) EU: Tony’s Delight EU https://tonysdelighteu.com
2) EU is live. Do not show “coming soon” anywhere.
3) UK and EU links must open in a new tab and use rel="noopener noreferrer".
4) Keep the footer layout exactly as it is. Do not change columns, spacing, fonts, colors, or ordering.
5) Do not modify existing footer links in Quick Links or Contact.

B) Footer Instagram links
1) Add an Instagram section in the footer without changing the overall footer layout. Use an existing social area if already present. If a social area was removed earlier, restore it where it was.
2) Add three Instagram links with these exact labels and destinations:
   1) Instagram USA: @tonysdelightusa https://www.instagram.com/tonysdelightusa/
   2) Instagram UK: @tonysdelightuk https://www.instagram.com/tonysdelightuk/
   3) Instagram EU: @tonysdelighteu https://www.instagram.com/tonysdelighteu/
3) Links should open in a new tab and use rel="noopener noreferrer".
4) If there are already Instagram icons, keep them and make sure they point to the correct URLs above. Do not delete icons. Do not change icon style. Do not change spacing.

C) Verification
1) Confirm https://tonysdelight.com loads.
2) Confirm https://www.tonysdelight.com loads.
3) Confirm footer region links work.
4) Confirm the three Instagram links work on desktop and mobile.

Deliverable
1) List the exact file paths changed.
2) Summarize exactly what you changed in 5 to 10 lines.
3) If there are multiple footer components, confirm which one is actually used on the homepage and only edit that one.
