You are editing the Tony’s Delight USA website (tonysdelight.com). We are using Vite + React (SPA) with an Express backend (server/index.ts). We want to improve SEO + AI search visibility (including ChatGPT Search) WITHOUT migrating frameworks and WITHOUT paid services.

ABSOLUTE RULES
1) Do NOT redesign the UI, layout, styling, or change existing page content.
2) Do NOT remove any existing routes, links, footer items, Instagram links, analytics tags, or sitemap.
3) Do NOT refactor the app or change the SPA router (wouter).
4) Make minimal server-side additions only.
5) After implementing, provide a clear report: files changed/added, and how to test.

GOAL (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
Phase 1
A) Add/confirm robots.txt at /robots.txt (HTTP 200) with explicit allowances for AI search bots and sitemap reference.
B) Add llms.txt at /llms.txt (HTTP 200) as a plain-text AI-friendly index of key pages.

Phase 2
C) Implement bot-aware server-side HTML snapshots for a small set of key routes so bots that do NOT execute JavaScript can still read meaningful HTML.
D) Humans must still get the normal SPA (index.html fallback). Do NOT break the existing SPA behavior.

PHASE 1 REQUIREMENTS

1) robots.txt
- Serve at https://tonysdelight.com/robots.txt with Content-Type text/plain
- Use this exact content (unless the framework requires tiny formatting changes):

User-agent: *
Allow: /

User-agent: OAI-SearchBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Allow: /

User-agent: bingbot
Allow: /

User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /

User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

Sitemap: https://tonysdelight.com/sitemap.xml

Notes:
- This allows AI search crawlers but blocks GPTBot (training) only.
- Do not block the whole site.

2) llms.txt
- Serve at https://tonysdelight.com/llms.txt with Content-Type text/plain
- Use this content:

Tony’s Delight USA is a wholesale and distribution company supporting food and consumer packaged goods brands in the United States.

Primary pages:

PHASE 2 REQUIREMENTS (BOT HTML SNAPSHOTS)

We need bots to receive simple, crawlable HTML for these routes:
- /
- /partners
- /quality
- /faq
- /for-brands

Implementation rules:
1) Do NOT touch the React pages for this phase.
2) Implement in Express BEFORE the SPA catch-all fallback (the "*" handler that sends index.html).
3) Detect bots by User-Agent using a conservative list that includes:
   - OAI-SearchBot
   - ChatGPT-User
   - bingbot
   - Googlebot
   - facebookexternalhit
   - WhatsApp
   - Twitterbot
   - Slackbot
   - Discordbot
   - LinkedInBot
4) Only serve snapshots for GET and HEAD requests that accept text/html.
5) For non-bots (normal users), continue to serve the SPA exactly as before.

Snapshot content:
- Create static HTML files in a new folder (example: server/snapshots/).
- One file per route:
  - home.html
  - partners.html
  - quality.html
  - faq.html
  - for-brands.html

Each snapshot HTML must:
- Be a complete HTML document (doctype, html, head, body).
- Include a unique <title> and <meta name="description"> for that page.
- Include canonical link to the exact page URL.
- Include one clear <h1>.
- Include 2–6 short paragraphs that summarize the page content in plain text.
- Include a small “Key links” list linking to the main pages.
- Not rely on JavaScript to display the content.
- Not include heavy CSS. Minimal inline styling is okay but not necessary.

Use these page-specific titles/descriptions and text (keep wording professional and consistent with existing site; you can lightly adjust but do not change meaning):

1) / (home.html)
Title: Tony’s Delight USA | Wholesale & Distribution

- Select international brands, U.S. market entry support
- Distribution/logistics guidance, branding feedback, Amazon enablement
- “Selective and thoughtful partnerships” language
- CTA to contact via info@tonysdelight.com and /contact

Routing behavior:
- If bot + path match, serve the corresponding snapshot file with status 200 and Content-Type text/html.
- For HEAD requests, respond with headers only (or let Express handle HEAD automatically).
- Otherwise continue to the existing static middleware and SPA fallback.

DELIVERABLE / VERIFICATION
After implementing, provide:
1) Files added/changed and what each does.
2) Confirm these URLs return 200:
   - /robots.txt
   - /llms.txt
   - /sitemap.xml
3) Explain how to test bot snapshots locally:
   - Example curl with a bot UA, e.g.
     curl -A "OAI-SearchBot" -I https://tonysdelight.com/partners
     curl -A "OAI-SearchBot" https://tonysdelight.com/partners
4) Confirm normal users still see the SPA (no visible change).

Do NOT proceed beyond Phase 1 and Phase 2. No additional SEO changes in this pass.
