Please do a full website QA check for tonysdelight.com. Do NOT redesign, refactor, or remove anything. This is a test and bug-fix pass only.

Rules
1) Do not change layout, styling, or copy unless required to fix a bug.
2) Do not remove any existing links, pages, footer items, or Instagram links.
3) If something is broken, fix it with the smallest possible code change.
4) After testing, provide a checklist report of what you tested and what you fixed, including file paths changed.

QA Checklist to run

A) Pages and routing
1) Confirm these routes load with HTTP 200 and show correct content:
   - /
   - /about
   - /products
   - /products/dry
   - /products/frozen
   - /products/seafood
   - /products/imported-brands
   - /partners
   - /quality
   - /faq
   - /jobs
   - /contact
2) Confirm that direct navigation to each URL works (copy paste URL into browser and hit enter), not just clicking links.
3) Confirm the 404 page works for a fake route, and has a link back home.

B) Navigation and links
1) Header nav links all work and do not 404.
2) Footer Quick Links all work.
3) Footer Our Regions links work:
   - USA https://tonysdelight.com
   - UK https://tonysdelight.co.uk (opens new tab, rel noopener noreferrer)
   - EU https://tonysdelighteu.com (opens new tab, rel noopener noreferrer)
4) Footer Instagram links work and open new tab:
   - https://www.instagram.com/tonysdelightusa/

   - https://www.instagram.com/tonysdelighteu/
5) Contact CTAs:
   - mailto:info@tonysdelight.com works

C) SEO and indexing basics
1) Confirm sitemap works:
   - /sitemap.xml returns raw XML (Content-Type application/xml)
2) Confirm robots.txt exists:
   - /robots.txt allows indexing and references sitemap
3) Confirm each page has a unique <title> and meta description.
4) Confirm favicon loads and is not the generic browser icon.

D) Mobile and browser compatibility
1) Check layout for mobile widths (iPhone size) and desktop.
2) Confirm site works in Safari and Chrome.
3) Confirm there are no console errors on load (or fix obvious ones).

E) Performance and assets
1) Confirm images load and are not broken.
2) Confirm there are no missing fonts or CSS files.
3) Confirm there are no mixed-content warnings.

Deliverable
1) Provide a QA report with:
   - Passed items
   - Failed items
   - Fixes applied (with file paths)
2) If any item cannot be fixed without major refactor, do not refactor. Just report it and suggest the minimal change approach.
