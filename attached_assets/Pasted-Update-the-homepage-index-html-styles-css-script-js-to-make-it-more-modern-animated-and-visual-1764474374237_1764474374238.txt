Update the homepage (index.html, styles.css, script.js) to make it more modern, animated, and visually engaging—similar to tonysdelighteu.com, while keeping my existing backend, Google Sheet integration, navbar, and footer unchanged.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT remove backend code, product loader code, or category pages. ONLY redesign the homepage visuals.

#######################################
### HOMEPAGE REDESIGN REQUIREMENTS
#######################################

1. HERO SECTION — Make it Premium + Modern
- Keep my headline exactly:
  “20+ Years of Excellence”
  “Premium Global Food Wholesale”
  “Your trusted partner for premium seafood, dry products, and frozen foods. Competitive prices, reliable service, and unmatched quality.”
- Use a clean FULL-WIDTH background image with a dark overlay.
- Add subtle parallax scroll effect.
- Add smooth fade-in text animations.
- Buttons should be rounded, premium-looking, with hover glow.

2. ADD ANGLED / DIAGONAL SECTION LIKE tonysdelighteu.com
Below the hero section:
- Add a diagonal white section divider.
- Inside this new section, add:
  • A big bold subheading:
    “Supplying the UK with Premium Asian & Seafood Products”
  • A short supporting paragraph.
  • A “Get Wholesale Prices” button.
- Include modern, abstract shapes (yellow/blue) similar to tonysdelighteu.com.
- Make shapes responsive and animated (slow float animation).

3. ADD A SECOND MODERN SECTION (Image + Text)
- Left side: product or warehouse image with soft shadow and rounded corners.
- Right side:
  • Heading: “Your Trusted Distributor”
  • Bullet points with icons:
      - Direct import pricing
      - Weekly UK-wide deliveries
      - Strict EU & Swiss compliance
      - Family-run reliability
- Add subtle animations (slide-in left/right).

4. MODERN SPACING + TYPOGRAPHY
- Use clean typography, smooth spacing, shadow depth, and sleek paddings.
- Make all elements properly scale on mobile.
- Ensure text wraps gracefully on tablets + phones.

5. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
- Must be fully responsive on all screens.
- On mobile:
  • Shapes must shrink or reposition to prevent overlap.
  • Text must be readable with proper spacing.
  • Buttons should be centered and full width.

6. KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE SITE THE SAME
- Do NOT change:
  • Navbar
  • Footer
  • Backend endpoints
  • Product category pages
  • Google Sheet integration
- Only redesign homepage visuals.

7. SMOOTH ANIMATIONS
Use CSS or AOS or GSAP for:
- fade-in
- slide-in
- parallax
- floating shapes
- diagonal transitions

### FILES TO UPDATE
