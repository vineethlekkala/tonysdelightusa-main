We need to add FAQPage structured data (JSON-LD) for the /faq page to improve SEO and AI search understanding.

ABSOLUTE RULES
1) Do NOT change UI, layout, styling, or visible FAQ content.
2) Do NOT alter routing, SPA behavior, or existing bot snapshot logic.
3) Add FAQPage JSON-LD ONLY on the /faq page.
4) Use JSON-LD only (no microdata).
5) Ensure bots AND humans receive the schema correctly.

WHERE TO ADD
- Add FAQPage JSON-LD to:
  A) The SPA-rendered /faq page (via head injection when route = /faq)
  B) The bot snapshot file: server/snapshots/faq.html

DO NOT add FAQ schema globally. Only for /faq.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Inject the JSON-LD into the <head> of the /faq route.
- Inject the same JSON-LD into server/snapshots/faq.html for crawler responses.
- Ensure it does not duplicate Organization JSON-LD.
- Ensure valid JSON (no trailing commas).

VERIFICATION REQUIRED
After implementation, confirm:
1) View-source on /faq shows FAQPage JSON-LD
2) curl -A "OAI-SearchBot" https://tonysdelight.com/faq returns FAQPage JSON-LD
3) No console errors
4) No visible UI changes
